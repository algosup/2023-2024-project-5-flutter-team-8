## Project Overview

Adopte un Candidat is a recruitment app available on mobile and desktop platforms. Its aim is to change the way of how people are recruited, basing the criteria on soft skills rather than hard skills and diplomas. It has been requested by the company "We Are Evolution.", wanting to renew the process of recuiting people.

Consequently, in this project, we are going to use Flutter, a language standardizing development among all the platforms targetted by the product.
