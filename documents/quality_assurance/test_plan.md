## 1 Product Analysis

### 1.2 Overview

The project aims to create a "Tinder style" recruitment application that 
matches companies with jobseekers using the Flutter software, which will 
be functional on android, desktop and tablets.

The app will ensure the anonymization of the user and will focus on the
soft skills, instead of solely on diplomas and proffesional experience.
There will be a "matching" proccess that will occur between the user and the 
company, which then the company will be able to contact the user via email.

## 2. Strategy

Due to the fact that the project needs to be completed in a short time period, we will be implementing the regression testing method in order for us to be able to catch bugs while we are in developement of the app.


## 3. Test Criteria

Refer to this document for all the test criterias.
