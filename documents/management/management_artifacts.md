# 2023 - 2024 Project-5 Flutter Team-8 - Management Artifacts

This document aims to centralize all the management artifact links and resources listed below:

- Tasks & Schedule
- RACI Matrix
- Risks & Assumptions
- Key Performance Indicators
- Weekly reports

## Tasks & schedule

You can view the breakdown of all the tasks we've identified for the duration of the project following [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QFKKn1Zu7k-iphcHswhBO5TsPfcmz9KxaEGjEYsmUTM/edit?usp=sharing).

It has been created using Google Sheets, ensuring a good comprehension already known by everyone, but also as a modular tool, which can implement metrics. Consequently, the client can track with ease the challenges and achievements done during the project.

## RACI Matrix

The RACI matrix of this project is as follows:

## Key Performance Indicators

### Definition of our KPIs

To enable the client to track our project's milestones, we have defined several quantitatively measurable KPIs. Below is a list of these KPIs along with their respective calculations.

#### Documents

The following KPIs are included in this section:

- **Functional specifications**
- **Technical specifications**
- **Test Plan**
- **User Manual**

The progress of these documents is measured using the following formula:

> *(current_number_of_sections / total_number_of_sections) \* 100*

Where:

- **current_number_of_sections**: The number of sections that are completely done.
- **total_number_of_sections**: The number of predefined sections in the document's outline, which may evolve.

#### Design

The KPIs in this section include:

- **Mock-ups**
- **User journey roadmap**

The percentage progress for these KPIs is calculated using this formula:

> *(current_number_of_pages_designed / total_number_of_pages_to_design) \* 100*

Where:

- **current_number_of_pages_designed**: The number of pages that have been prototyped.
- **total_number_of_pages_to_design**: The total number of pages planned to be designed during the project analysis.

#### Development

This section tracks the following KPIs:

- **Logged out interfaces**
- **User interfaces**
- **Company interfaces**

Given the complexity and time required for development, we include progress on partially completed pages. The progress is calculated using:

> *((current_number_of_fully_coded_pages + sum_unfinished_pages_advancements) / total_designed_pages) \* 100*

Where:

- **current_number_of_fully_coded_pages**: The number of pages that are fully completed.
- **sum_unfinished_pages_advancements**: The cumulative progress of each unfinished page, with progress for each page ranging from 0 to 1.
- **total_designed_pages**: The total number of pages defined during project analysis and design.

By utilizing these formulas, we ensure that our progress tracking is clear and consistent, and provides a realistic view of our project's status to the client.
