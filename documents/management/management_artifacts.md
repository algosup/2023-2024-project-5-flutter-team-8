# 2023 - 2024 Project-5 Flutter Team-8 - Management Artifacts

This document aims to centralize all the management artifact links and resources listed below:

- Tasks & schedule
- RACI Matrix
- Risks & Assumptions
- Key Performance Indicators
- Weekly reports

## Tasks & schedule

You can view the breakdown of all the tasks we've identified for the duration of the project following [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QFKKn1Zu7k-iphcHswhBO5TsPfcmz9KxaEGjEYsmUTM/edit?usp=sharing).

It has been created using Google Sheets, ensuring a good comprehension already known by everyone, but also as a modular tool, which can easily implement metrics in a clear manner. Conseuqently, the client can track with ease the challenges and achievements done during the project.
