# Weekly Report - Week 4

## Overview

This week marked a turnaround in our team's motivation following a previous week with no dedicated project time. We successfully revitalized team spirit and motivation, as well as achieving significant milestones, bringing the project a step forward in a short period of time.

## Accomplishments

1. **Completion of Technical Specifications**
    - We finalized the technical specifications, detailing all technical aspects and guidelines for the app development phase.
2. **Completed Testing Planning**
    - We refined our test strategy, adding new test cases and completing the test plan document.
3. **Major Advancements in User Manual**
    - Our technical writer made significant progress on the user manual, creating concise yet comprehensive descriptions of the app's expected usage.
4. **Development of Numerous Interfaces**
    - We focused our efforts on app development, aiding the software engineer in meeting objectives. These interfaces were tested to ensure alignment with specifications, client needs, and final design.

## Challenges

1. **Coordination of Development Efforts**
    - Coordinating all team members assigned to development tasks was challenging. It required briefing on coding conventions and organizing the app's structure, which took a lot of time and efforts for the people who were already coding.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Complete Application Development**
    - We aim to deliver a working prototype of "Adopte Un Candidat" by next Friday. Our primary focus will be on ensuring the prototype meets all requirements.
2. **Finalize User Manual**
    - The user manual will be completed and reviewed, providing a thorough guide for both reviewers and the client alongside the app prototype.
3. **Continue Testing Phase**
    - We will continue testing both existing and new interfaces to ensure a bug-free solution.

## Conclusion

This week, we caught up with project deadlines thanks to the team's overtime efforts and the collaboration on common tasks. The team is pleased with our progress and current pace, and we are pleased to be on the right way to meet the deadlines.
