# Weekly Report - Week 2

## Overview

This week marked the concrete beginning of the project's technical side, greatly helped by the courses we completed on Dart and Flutter. We also finalized the design phase, ensuring it is ready for client review.

## Accomplishments

1. **Functional Specifications Finalization**
   - Completed and submitted the functional specifications document to the client, who approved its content.
2. **Completion of Mock-ups**
   - Sent the app mock-ups to the client for feedback.
3. **Landing & Login Pages Development**
    - Successfully developed most of the logged-out interfaces of the app. However, we are currently facing an estimated 20-hour delay due to the focus on finalizing the functional and continuing technical specifications.
4. **Risk Evaluation**
    - Conducted a risk evaluation and created a mitigation plan to prevent major issues that might hinder project completion.

## Challenges

1. **Focus on User Experience**
    - Concentrating on the User Experience was more challenging and time-consuming than anticipated, leading to significant delays.
2. **Development Pace Hindrance**
    - Our developer faced difficulties with displaying SVGs correctly. This issue was due to the incorrect use of an attribute in the SVG display class, causing overtime and delays in page delivery.
3. **User Manual Creation**
    - Due to the previously mentioned delays and the technical writer's involvement in short-term tasks, the User Manual has not yet been started.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Catch Up on Development Delays**
    - Address the delays in page development to align with the Gantt Chart and ensure timely project delivery.
2. **Work on Technical Specifications**
    - Continue drafting the technical specifications, which are currently 30% complete, to facilitate a smooth development phase.
3. **Start User Manual Creation**
    - Begin creating a comprehensive user manual, detailing the app's intended usage for all user types.
4. **Continue Testing Phase Planning**
    - Plan the testing phase to ensure the product is bug-free and meets the client's requirements, focusing on defining test cases for the application.

## Conclusion

Despite the challenges faced this week, our team is persevering thanks to strong team spirit and effective communication. We are optimistic about catching up on delays and are eager to dive deeper into the app development phase next week, exclusively doing overtime to counter the absence of any project time.
