# Weekly Report - Week 6

## Overview

This week was primarily dedicated to preparing for the final presentation, which culminated in its delivery to We Are Evolution representatives. We also addressed minor bugs in the application to enhance the user experience.

## Accomplishments

1. **Final Presentation Preparation**
   - We successfully created a comprehensive presentation, including all necessary information to help the jury understand the project's key points and the rationale behind our decisions.
2. **Final Presentation With Stakeholders**
   - We delivered our project presentation and retrospective to the stakeholders successfully, clearly answering all the client's questions.

## Challenges

1. **Creating an Understandable Presentation**
   - It was challenging to create a presentation that simplified the technical aspects of our application while still explaining its inner workings. Additionally, we wanted to highlight the app's most distinctive features, which required us to develop the presentation almost from scratch.

## Plan for Next Week

This week marked the project's end, and no further plans are made to continue working on it.

## Conclusion

This week concluded a project that our team found to be a valuable learning experience. We are proud of the polished final product, which resembles a fully functional application.
