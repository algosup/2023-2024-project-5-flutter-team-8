# Weekly Report - Week 1

## Overview

This week marked the beginning of our project with a strong focus on the kick-off and initial planning stages. We engaged with the client to understand their requirements and began the design process for the application.

## Accomplishments

1. **Project Kick-off**
   - The client provided a detailed briefing, clarifying their expectations and addressing any ambiguities from the initial brief received in late April.
2. **Planning**
   - We outlined the project's steps and created a comprehensive Gantt Chart to guide our timeline and milestones.
3. **Design & Mock-ups**
   - We developed the graphical charter based on the provided logo and mapped out the user journey.
   - Initial mock-ups for the job-seeker view have been designed.
4. **Functional Specifications**
   - We have drafted most of the functional specifications document, laying a solid foundation for the technical specifications.
5. **Splash Screen**
   - The app's splash screen has been fully developed.

## Challenges

1. **New Team Dynamics**
   - As a newly formed team, with many first-year students, we spent time understanding our roles and responsibilities, requiring substantial initial research.
2. **Learning Flutter**
   - While Flutter is relatively straightforward, most team members are new to it and are currently building their proficiency.
3. **Integration of a New Student**
   - We welcomed a new team member, Pavlo, and are assisting him in acclimating to the school's environment and team processes.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Complete Functional Specifications**
   - Finalize the functional specifications, allowing room for adjustments as the project progresses.
2. **Begin Development**
   - With client approval of the mock-ups and a preliminary technical framework, our software engineer will start the coding phase.
3. **Conduct Risk Evaluation**
   - Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies to maintain transparency and manage expectations with the client.

## Conclusion

The project has had a promising start with strong team spirit and effective communication. This foundation enhances our confidence in meeting project deadlines and delivering quality results to the client.
