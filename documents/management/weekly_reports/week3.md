# Weekly Report - Week 3

## Overview

This week brought significant changes in our motivation and the projectâ€™s progress. Despite some setbacks, the team remained focused on the project objectives. However, the average pace and time for task completion were lower than expected, even with several team members working overtime.

## Accomplishments

1. **Technical Specifications Progress**
   - We made substantial progress on the technical specifications, completing about 80% of the document.
2. **Advancements in Testing**
   - Significant steps were taken in defining our testing strategy, including the development of most test cases.

## Challenges

1. **Lack of Dedicated Project Time**
   - No scheduled project time this week meant we had to coordinate via Slack rather than working together in person.
2. **Decreased Motivation**
   - Many team members reported a drop in motivation, largely due to the absence of dedicated project time.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Complete Technical Specifications**
   - Finalize and refine the technical specifications to ensure the development phase adheres to all conventions and constraints defined by the tech lead.
2. **Develop User Manual**
   - Create a comprehensive user manual with instructions and resources for both users and the client on how to use the solution.
3. **Finalize Test Plan**
   - Complete the test plan by focusing on critical features and delivering a thorough overview of our testing strategy and action plan to the client.

## Conclusion

This week was challenging, primarily due to the lack of dedicated project time, which disrupted the team dynamic established in previous weeks. The potential delays and setbacks from this week will need to be addressed in the upcoming week to ensure timely project delivery.
