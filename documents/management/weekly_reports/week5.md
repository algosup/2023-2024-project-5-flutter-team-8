# Weekly Report - Week 5

## Overview

This week marked the end of the development phase of the app along with the submission of the user manual to the reviewers. Despite the intensity, a significant amount of work was accomplished in a short time.

## Accomplishments

1. **Finalized Job Seeker Interfaces Development**
   - The user interfaces for job seekers were successfully refined and completed with fully functional features.
2. **Completed User Manual**
   - The user manual was filled with all the necessary information for end users to navigate our app.
3. **Concluded Testing Phase**
   - Our solution was thoroughly tested, following the QA guidelines. Most tests passed, except for one, making our solution nearly bug-free.

## Challenges

1. **Priority Dilemma**
   - We faced a major issue this week: balancing quality for both companies and job seekers. After a team meeting, we decided to prioritize quality over quantity, focusing on refining the job seeker interfaces.
2. **Time Constraints**
   - The priority dilemma was compounded by a lack of time, with an unexpected Flutter exam taking a full day for most team members. Despite significant overtime, we couldn't fully catch up with our deadlines.
3. **Bug Identification**
   - While refining our version, we identified numerous bugs. Some took a long time to resolve, which overall slowed down our development pace.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Prepare Final Presentation**
   - Next Friday, we will present our final product to We are Evolution representatives, explaining the entire development process.

## Conclusion

This week was intense for all team members, who are relieved by the progress made so far, even though some frustration remains due to the incomplete app. Overall, it was a productive week marked by the completion of a polished product segment.
