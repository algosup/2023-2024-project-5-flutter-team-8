| Team Member      | Mad                                                                      | Sad                                                                                                           | Glad                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Antoine PREVOST  | - We don't have the company interface, which is a shame.                 | - Not all team members were equally involved, despite encouragement.                                          | - We have a finalized product for what has been done.<br>- The team was involved, and it was a pleasure to work with them.                                                                                        |
| Thomas PLANCHARD | - Some people should have been more involved in decisions and processes. | - We needed more time to complete the project as planned.                                                     | - The final application closely resembles the mockups.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Maxime THIZEAU   | - Oral questions.                                                        | - Time was too short to complete the company side.                                                            | - The application is beautiful and nearly functional.<br>- A great job was accomplished overall.                                                                                                                  |
| Quentin CLEMENT  | - Not everyone was equally invested in the project.                      | - Time was short, and we didn’t manage to fix some bugs and implement all the features we envisioned.         | - The team atmosphere was excellent, motivating, and friendly.<br>- Having four dedicated members made a significant difference.                                                                                  |
| Pavlo PRENDI     | - I failed to speak at the end of the presentation.                      | - I wish I could have been more vocal and helpful during project hours.<br>- I wish I could have tested more. | - Everyone was very nice and helpful for my first project at ALGOSUP.<br>- The app turned out to be incredible.<br>- I gained knowledge of a new language and now know how to work on a software-related project. |
| Arthur LEMOINE   | - Franck's focus on "feature-creep" during the presentation.             | - We lacked time to implement the company side.                                                               | - The design is perfect and very clean.                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Key Achievements

- The working prototype has a great design, and the developed pages are polished and refined.
- The final presentation conveyed all key information clearly to the client and was better than previous presentations.
- Git & GitHub organization was overall clear and efficient.
- Our motivation benefited from team cohesion and management that allowed members to work independently.
- Pavlo, our new member, learned to work as a team on a software project.

## Challenges

- Our project tended to expand into side features that, while relevant, were not critical.
- Some team members were not as involved in the project as others.
- We faced numerous dead ends, and our development pace was hindered by technical issues.
- Respecting deadlines and managing time effectively were consistent challenges throughout the project.

## Root Causes

- The definition of critical features should have been approached with more critical thinking and review.
- A lack of strict management and oversight led to some team members being less involved.
- We began developing the application without mastering the language, leading to functionality issues.
- The project duration was short, with only five weeks for the development phase, making it difficult to meet deadlines while aiming for a refined application.

## Lessons Learnt

- Better management with improved risk anticipation and efforts to involve all team members should lead to a better product and less stress towards deadlines.
- Mastering the programming language before starting the development phase will help avoid future problems.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience for everyone, despite technical and management challenges. The insights gained will be beneficial for delivering higher quality work in future projects, and the team will work to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
