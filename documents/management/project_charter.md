# Tinder-like recruitment app - Project Charter

## Project definition

This project aims to create a Tinder-like recruitment app valuing soft skills rather than hard skills.

The client is the company "We Are Evolution.", a creative employer branding agency. Our contact point is Lilou Jourdannaud, the communication intern.

## Scope

This project should be done using Flutter and be compatible with all types of devices.

This implementation should be only targeting the front-end at first and should offer an interface to candidates, and companies but also "We are evolution." as an administrator.

## Project Plan

On May 13th 2024, we had a meeting with the client to explain some blurry points written in the brief that had been transmitted to us during the holidays. It was decided that additional questions would be made via e-mail and that those communication documents could be uploaded to Github if needed.

This project will be using the waterfall project method due to the limited timeframe. However, we plan to use some aspects of SCRUM management with iterations over an MVP. This incrementation will limit the number of bugs by allowing regression testing.

The planning will be made by defining the tasks and objectives pointed out in the brief and during the meeting. Each of these will be sorted by importance and distributed accordingly. To manage them, we will use a GitHub project in our repository to centralize all the resources. Additional management tools will be used to track the achievements and bottlenecks during the project and keep the client informed during the whole duration of the project.

After the final presentation which will take place on June, 21st 2024, we will do a post-mortem analysis to summarize what happened and make a report to the client.

## Deliverables

The main deliverable is the source code of the application. In addition, to ensure we stay on the right track, we will submit multiple mock-ups and prototypes to the client.

Additional documents will be given to the client:

- Functional Specification
- Technical Specification
- Test Plan
- User Manual
- Management Planning & Weekly reports

In addition, a presentation of our work will be done to the client as a 15-minute long presentation.
